Project Name: Lunar Lander 112

Description: Lunar Lander 112 is my take on Atari’s 1979 classic, “Lunar Lander.” There are three main modes: classic, frenzy, and free-play. Classic is based off the gameplay of the original. You control a lunar lander approaching the surface of the "moon" and it is your objective to land it safely on a flat, level surface without wasting too much fuel. Frenzy is a more challenging and fast-paced mode with missile-shooting enemies, crashing meteors, and more. In free-play mode, there is no set objective and the player is free to play around with their ship with smoother physics and infinite fuel. A friend can also join in to fool around.

Main File is named 'LunarLander112'. Run this file to play the game.
